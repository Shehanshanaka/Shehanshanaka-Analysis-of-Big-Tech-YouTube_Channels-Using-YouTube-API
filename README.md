# Shehanshanaka-Analysis-of-Big-Tech-YouTube_Channels-Using-YouTube-API

## "Insights that I gathered after analyzing these tech giants' YouTube channels."

•	The number of views a video receives is often correlated with the number of likes it gets. Please note that this correlation doesn't imply a cause-and-effect relationship, and the relationship can work both ways. Likes could be a better indicator of interaction than the number of views. It seems that likes tend to follow the concept of "social proof," meaning that the more views a video has, the more people are likely to like it.

•	Most-viewed videos tend to have an average title length of 20-45 characters. Titles that are too short or too long appear to harm viewership for these YouTubers.

•	We can't see a clear relationship between the number of videos uploaded per day of the week and the overall number of videos uploaded. Perhaps this lack of pattern is what contributes to their success. While there are no clear patterns, it makes sense that as a tech content creator, they should provide the most up-to-date technology knowledge to their viewers in order to be popular and gain more views.
